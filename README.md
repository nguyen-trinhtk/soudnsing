<h2>Overview</h2>
The population of the 65 and older age group is experiencing a gradually growing trend both globally and in Vietnam. Besides physical difficulties, many older people are susceptible to mood and/or anxiety disorders and neurological issues (World Health Organization, 2017). Music has been shown to improve a person’s mental and physical state. Hence, it is plausible to use musical methods to encourage the elderly’s well-being. Hence, I am implementing a karaoke application targeting the Vietnamese elderly population to enhance their health status.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to the United Nations (2019), globally, there were 703 million persons aged 65 or over in 2019; however, this number is projected to rise to over 1.5 billion by 2050. In Vietnam, the elderly population’s annual growth rate in the period from 2009 to 2019 was 4.35% in comparison with 1.14% of the total population (UNFPA & Ministry of Planning and Investment General Statistics Office, 2021). </p>
<p></p>Mental health issues of various intensities are prevalent among this age group. Specifically, loneliness (Berg-Weger et al., 2020), mood-anxiety disorders (Valiengo et al., 2016), and depression (Fiske et al., 2009) are concerning among the elderly.
<p>Music has been shown to enhance the elderly’s overall mental health. In fact, it is shown to be effective in memory improvement (Chan et al., 1998); stress relief and pain intensity reduction (Loewy, 2012); and physical comfort (Boltd, 1996). Furthermore, singing is said to have positive pulmonary effects (Bonilha et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Soud n' Sing is a singing application designed especially for the elderly to help them entertain, destress, and improve memory. This recreational application aims to help older people resolve their mental health issues with a simple form of music training: karaoke sing-a-long. The target audience of this product would be the 65 or older age group in Vietnam; however, anybody can benefit from this app.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>This project includes two parts: the hardware and the software. For the hardware, I have assembled a wristband that assesses users' vocal performances (refer to the video at the top). For the software, I've designed and prototyped an interactive interface on iPad.</p>
